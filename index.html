    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    <h3>By: Caleb Tyler</h3>
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>Changing the projection on which a map is shown in Qgis is simple. It is valuable to see different projections because each projection is useful for some purpose. All projections make sacrifices of either shape, distance, direction. Different projections preserve different of these aspects, thus so many various projections are useful. Several projections are shown below with some additional observations.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map uses a cylindrical projection which has been slightly distorted to preserve land area. This is seen in the elliptical shape of Tissot's indatrices towards the north and south. </h3>

    <h2>WGS84/Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The following map is conformal, meaning small scale shapes and angles are preserved. You can tell this projection is conformal because each tissot indicatrix is a circle/proportional. </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel Projections</h2>
    <h3>This map has a standard line along the equator so that is where it is least distorted. The map is an ellipse because it decreases distortion towards the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is least distorted along the prime meridian and equator. Its rounded shape allows for more land area to be preserved on all parts of the map.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is an equivalent projection, meaning that land area is preserved. You can tell because this is equivalent because each of Tissot's Indicatrix have the same area.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map preserves direction near the North Pole. Any point traveled directly from the north pole will have preserved direction.</h3>

    <h2>World Polyconic Projection</h2>
    <h3>There is little distortion around both the north and south pole as well as the prime meridian. This is the case because this is a polyconic projection so there are more than one standard line.</h3>

    <h2>World Two Point Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map was formed using a conic projection at more than one point.</h3>
